## Final results

So what can we conclude?  
With which file format and which method is it fastest to execute the same request?  

Let's have a look! First, let's aggregate all the benchmark results:

```{r}
#| label: final-results-rbind

bmk_results <- rbind(
  csv_bmk,
  unique_parquet_bmk,
  partitioned_parquet_bmk,
  duckdb_bmk
)
```


```{r}
#| label: final-results-plot
autoplot(bmk_results)
```
