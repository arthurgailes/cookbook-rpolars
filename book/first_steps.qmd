# First steps with Polars and R

Until the R polars package is uploaded to CRAN, [the polars package development team](https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars/graphs/contributors) offers [several solutions](https://rpolars.github.io/#install) for installation.

The most practical one in my opinion at the moment is to use [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/search/) and install like this: 

``` {r installation}
#| eval = FALSE
install.packages("polars", repos = "https://rpolars.r-universe.dev")
```

To avoid conflicts with other packages and base R function names, polarsâ€™s top level functions are hosted in the pl namespace, and accessible via the pl$ prefix. 

To convert an R data frame to a Polars DataFrame:

``` {r conversion}
library(polars)
data <- pl$DataFrame(iris)
data
```

For example, to count the number of lines of the iris data frame :  

::: {.panel-tabset}
## polars

```{r height-function}
data$height
```

## R base

```{r nrow-function}
nrow(iris)
```
