# Lazy execution

Let's start this chapter by citing official documentation:

> Polars supports two modes of operation: lazy and eager. In the eager API the query is executed immediately while in the lazy API the query is only evaluated once it is 'needed'. Deferring the execution to the last minute can have significant performance advantages that is why the Lazy API is preferred in most cases.
